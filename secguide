[TITLE] Basic Guide

[SubTitle] Connecting to the server

If you have never connected to your servers CLI (Command Line Interface) this guide will teach you
how to connect to the server via SSH (Secure Shell Protocol) 

There are a few ways to SSH into a server. You can either use your computers terminal/command prompt or
you can install a SSH clinet such as PuTTY or Termius and much more.

[Bold] Links to SSH Clients
PuTTY https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
Termius https://account.termius.com/

in this example we will use the IP Address 192.168.1.2 and the default port for ssh is port 22
with the username "root" and password "myguide"

[SubTitle] What does the script do

Once you sucessfully log into your Linux server you can either manually install and configure
security settings and software, or you can run this custom github script that will automate most
security configurations and automatically install software that you would need.

This script will automatically do the following

# update and upgrade
# install unattended-upgrades
# configure unattended-upgrades
# install fail2ban
# configure fail2ban (->restart)
# install ufw
# enable and configure ufw (ask user for ports)
# configure ufw to protect against portscans and botattacks *
# install sshd
# configure sshd (->restart) (no keys)
# configure IPTables for PortScanning and BotAttacks
# install portsentry
# configure portsentry
# install sshguard
# configure sshguard
# install and run chrootkit
# create a new user for sudo and disable root

Please make sure to run this script in sudo or root in order for it to run propperly.

Notice at the end of the script it will ask you to create a new user, please ensure that you
follow the steps in the script as it will disable the user root and will no longer allow you
to ssh in with the user root.

[SubTitle] What are ports and how to open/close them

There are two ways that most people explain what a port is. You can either think of a port as a 
Door to your home, the more ports you open the more doors you have. or
A port is like poking a hole into your firewall.

Network ports are something like communcation channels where servers or network can allow software
to send data between the firewall.

[SubTitle] How to configure UFW
UFW is a Universal Firewall for linux machines. We can use this to setup a basic but efficent 
firewall with ease.
First we are going to want to go ahead and make sure it is downloaded by doing the following command

(Picture of downloading ufw)

once we download UFW we can start configuring it for our needs. First we are going to need to figure out 
what services need what ports open. We will need to open the port for SSH which is port 22 and can be found
in the picture of the port lists. In order to open port 22 we can do the following

(Pictures of opening port SSH)

For this next example we will only open port 3306 as tcp and then we will block port 53 as udp
